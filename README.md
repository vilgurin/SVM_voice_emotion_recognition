# SVM_voice_emotion_recognition
Support Vector Machine for voice emotion recognition, based on SMO algorithm and MFCC method of feature extraction, both written from scratch.
To start using the program just run main.py.

As for now, SVM supports only 3 emotions: sadness,happiness and anger, even though there are more features in the dataset, so you are free to train your models to grant the support for more feelings.
